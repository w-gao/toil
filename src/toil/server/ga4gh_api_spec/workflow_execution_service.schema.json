For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.\n\n- RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor has been started.\n\n- PAUSED: The task is paused. An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.\n\n\n - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error\nand output files have been successfully uploaded.\n\n\n - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,\nthis means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.\n\n\n - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,\nfor example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out of disk space, etc.\n\n\n - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.\n\n\n  - CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process of stopping.
